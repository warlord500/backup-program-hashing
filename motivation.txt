this is a motivational file. 
it is my battle plan. 

I need backup system thats meets these demands needs to be faster than 
rsync while able to retain or transfer move information.
its needs to be able to not create excess duplicates. 
it is not a version system. 
it is not a cache system. 
this system works with immutable data only. meaning technically data doesn't change ever. 
the backups can only add data at most. deleting is not needed or required.
restructuring so the data has the same organization as the base system is necessary. 


its only goal is to move data from one file system to another as fast as possible! 


actual steps of execution

the battle plan, 
use hashes from files to compare for both systems. 
if hashes matchup, then that file can be ignored. 
if hashes dont matchup then that file needs to be transferred.
the transferred goes in the same relative location as the origin system. 
if the origin system has a file with different relative location as the recvier 
the receiver will move file to match origin. 



notes more actual steps:
step 1: get hashes for file. 
step 2: figure out decent storage,(thinking sql, plain text)
step 3: work small figure  for one file then whole folder then sub folders.
